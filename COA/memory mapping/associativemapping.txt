we remove the Line field entirely, we just have tag field and the word field.
wherever a free cache line is found, the address block is assigned to that.

advantage: improves hit ratio
disadvantage: you have to compare with all existing fields to get a hit, because now we don't have % anymore.

replacement policies:
    can replace least recently used line
    can replace 0-127 in order and loop back
