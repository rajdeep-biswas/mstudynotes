convert the hex to regular binary.
identify the sign, biased exponent and significand parts.
for biased exponent part, now, subtract 127 (instead of adding it).
for significand part, just remember there is an implicit 1 in the decimal part (before the point),
    and after the decimal is whatever you actually have at your significand part.
move decimal point appropriately; to make 2^n into 2^0.
convert to decimal if needed.
