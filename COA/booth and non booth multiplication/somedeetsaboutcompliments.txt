To easily get 2's comp - start from LSB and go left, find the first 1 that appears, flip everything to the left of it but not itself and anything to its right.

* WHEN performing booth's signed, always match up the bits (take one extra bit for the sign bit) and remember to apply 2's complement to that extra bit as well.
and when you get the answer, if the sign bit is '1' meaning it is negative and the answer you have got is actually frankenstein'd (2's complemented),
    you will need to find its 2's complement again to find the magnitude of the expected number.
    it just always wise to check your answer with the decimal multiplication result.

unsigned booth div -
it is also wise to write down -M since you'll be doing A-M sometimes so you can just simply do A + -M
and Pooja has given a neat simplification of the flowchart
AQM | A is init 0, Q is dividend, M is divisor

unsigned booth mult -
CAQM | C is one extra bit that is always 0 (fuck knows why its there), A is your accumulator thing, Q is the multiplicand and M is multiplier

signed booth mult (take care to complement the extra (sign) bit here as well) -
AQQ'M | A is accumulator, Q is multiplicand, Q' is one extra bit that you take, M is multiplier
