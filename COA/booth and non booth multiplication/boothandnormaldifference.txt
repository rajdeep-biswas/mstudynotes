When shifting to the right, for unsigned, you always get a fresh new '0' at the MSB. (non booth) (this is regular right shift)
When shifting to the right, for signed, you copy the bit at MSB to the next and leave the MSB to itself (booth); this is probably to retain the sign. (this arithmetic right shift)

M is multiplier.
Q is multiplicand. (although it doesn't matter which one is which)

When counting number of additions and subtractions. It's always +1 to an addition and a subtraction, each, if you've entered and left a block of 1s. (simply: MSB is not 1)
And if MSB is 1, you've never left the leftmost block of 1s, hence that will +1 only to the subtraction count.
