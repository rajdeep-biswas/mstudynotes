Sn.m
First bit is 'S'igned bit
Next n bits are integer
Next m bits are fraction

You can always find the regular sum of the bits after decimal and divide the sum by 2^m to get the decimal representation, its easier that way.
For example, 0.1001 would be 9 (1001) divided by 16 (since m = 4).

If you are to perform any arithmetic between two numbers in some fixed point representations, make sure they both have the same representation.

Range will be defined as -
upper limit: (2 ^ n) - 1 decimal part, and 1 - (2 ^ m) fraction part.
So a total for sx.y = -(2 ^ x - 2 ^ -y) to (2 ^ x - 2 ^ -y) would be your range.
