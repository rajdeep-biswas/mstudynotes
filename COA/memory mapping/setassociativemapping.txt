a grouping of 1 set is made of x cache lines
now we do block number modulo % cache set
tag / set / word fields

number of sets = number of cache lines / number of lines in a set
example, if you have 4 cache lines in a set and a total of 128 cache lines, you'll have 2 ^ 5 sets (i.e 2 ^ (7 - 2))
note: this '5' is also your Set field length i.e you'll have bits determining the Set field.
